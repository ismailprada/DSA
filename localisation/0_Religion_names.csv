puniner_DESC;The pantheon of the Twelvegods is the most common and most influential religion in all of Aventuria, guiding spiritual life in almost the whole Middenrealm. It evolved out of a mixture of the gods and beliefs of settlers from the Gyldenland and native Aventurian peoples, particularly Tulamids. The pantheon in it's modern form was codified when, out of the chaos of the religious conflicts of the Dark Ages, emperor Silem-Horas decreed his famous edict named after himself in the year 98 before Bosparan's Fall. A pillar of support in all of life's hardships for the believer while acknowledging a great number of smaller cults as demigods allied to the true gods, the Twelve have been a force for good and peace throughout most of history. The twelve gods and their aspects are: \n §MPraios§! – Alveran's sovereign, God of sun, law and nobility\n §MRondra§! – Goddess of battle and honour\n §MEfferd§! – God of the seas and storms\n §MTravia§! – Goddess of family, home and hospitality\n §MBoron§! – God of death, sleep and dreams\n §MHesinde§! – Goddess of science and magic\n §MFirun§! – God of winter and hunt\n §MTsa§! – Goddess of peace, birth and fertility\n §MPhex§! – God of luck, trade and thievery\n §MPeraine§! – Goddess of agriculture and medicine\n §MIngerimm§! – God of smithing and craftsmanship\n §MRahja§! – Goddess of love, wine and music;The pantheon of the Twelvegods is the most common and most influential religion in all of Aventuria, guiding spiritual life in almost the whole Middenrealm.

Loriano and his supporters seek to return the church to it's principles that governed it in the old Bosparanian Empire. This includes a higher regard for Horas of course, but also a more tolerant approach to magic and those that wield it. While many are open to such a reform to the church in the parishes of Fairfield, believers in the Middenrealm usually view them as dangerous dissenters.;The principleists are a theological school in the Church of Praios, originally founded by Staryun Loriano in Vinsalt.

For her insurgence she was imprisoned in a stone in the sky, where Phex is tasked to watch over her.

Fearing for their lives, the people of Al'Anfa fled into the arms of the Nemekathean sect who try to divine Boron's will through dreams and intoxication and see ritualized suicide as a way of becoming one with Boron.

Therefore Nandus priests can often be found wandering throughout Aventuria, collecting new insights very similar to those ordained to Hesinde, Nandus' mother. However, where Hesinde seeks to collect knowledge, Nandus wishes to teach it to all willing. This often brings them in conflict with the priests of Praios (and nobility) who question a farmer's need for literacy and numeracy as long as they know their rightful place in the world. Disciples of Nandus are not overly altruistic however, should a learner prove too ignorant for their wisdom they will quickly move on to the next. The priests hope to do their part in furthering all of humanities' knowledge, so mortals will one day achieve unification with Nayrakis, the essence of Los and cosmological force of order.;While the most important temple of the Church of Nandus is in Vinsalt, his priests don't regard hierarchy very highly.

The son of Rahja was, according to legend, desired by all women he set eyes upon, except for Satuaria who taunted him. So one night, Levthan subdued her with the help of an enchanted tie given to him by Hesinde and conquered Satuaria. But she took her revenge on him when she turned Levthan into a common ram, cursed to spend his days on a dry meadow, feeding of fierce herbs. It is said Satuaria later often rued her curse for she was filled equally with love and hate for her conqueror. But every once in a while Levthan manages to shake off his curse for a night, spending it in a wild ecstatic round dance with those devoted to Satuaria. Some suggest Levthan has long abandoned everything holy and is now a follower of Rahja's wicked adversary Belkelel. Levthan's horns, reminiscent of the demonic beings of the 7th sphere have only strengthened these suspicions.;While the only official temple of the god of virility and animalistic strength is located in Fasar, many clearings, woods and groves all over Aventuria are said to be places of worship for Levthan.

The Twelvegods then are guardian spirits, tasked by Rur to protect the disk and it's wonders.
